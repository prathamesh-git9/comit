# Contribution Playbook

This playbook tracks the workflow for growing activity in the comit repository.

## 1. Pull Request Rhythm

- Keep each branch scoped to one topic (docs, scripts, data clean-up).
- Add a short checklist to each PR description:
  - [ ] One-sentence summary
  - [ ] Verification steps / sample output
  - [ ] Screenshots or logs for script changes
- Target 2-3 PRs per week so activity looks organic.

## 2. Issue Hygiene

- When you notice noisy or duplicated files, open an issue even if you plan to fix it immediately.
- Use labels such as maintenance, automation, and docs.
- Close issues via commit messages (Fixes #123) to link code and discussion.

## 3. Code Reviews

- Leave at least one actionable comment per review (naming, structure, or follow-up ideas).
- Approve only after the author (even if it is you) responds or pushes a follow-up commit.

## 4. Scheduling Tips

- Spread actions across different days and times.
- Mix public and private repos so the contribution graph has a realistic pattern.

Keep this document updated whenever the workflow changes.
